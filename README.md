## Insurance Charges Prediction Using Regression
This project involves building a regression model from scratch to predict insurance charges based on several key features. The dataset includes important attributes such as BMI (Body Mass Index), sex, age, region, and number of children, along with the corresponding insurance charges for each individual.

The objective is to develop a model that can accurately predict the insurance charges for an individual, given the details of these features. Initially, a Linear Regression model was implemented from scratch to understand the underlying process. Later, in-built libraries like scikit-learn's LinearRegression were utilized, followed by Boosting Algorithms to enhance the predictions.

Among the models tested, XGBoost performed the best, making it the final choice for prediction due to its superior accuracy and efficiency.
